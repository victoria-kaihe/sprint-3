What is my site's primary purpose?
Right now, my site's primary purpose is to apply what I'm learning in the sprints. It is also to reflect on the things I am learning both in terms of soft skills and technical skills.

Who is my target audience?
At the time of writing, my target audience consists of my peers and my tutors.

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?
I want to visitors to read my blog posts, and be able to (hopefully) enjoy the content without being overwhelmed by the design because I got too carried away, or distracted by lots of extra links because I tried to fit too much in. I hope visitors find something that they can relate to from their own experiences of learning to code, or maybe that they'll find something helpful, or see something from a perspective they hadn't considered before. I hope that visitors get a bit of a sense of who I am as both a person and an aspiring developer.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?
I will take what I've learned from the first two sprints, the resources in this sprint, as well as the things I've picked from other sites that I like and apply them to the redesign of my site. I will remain open to feedback, and critique myself at every step.
